== Overview

This repository is an archive of http://prc-tools.sourceforge.net/[prc-tools]
2.3 (and its GCC cross-compilation toolchain), with patches enabling it to build
and run on modern Linux and macOS systems.

http://prc-tools.sourceforge.net/[prc-tools] is a collection of tools supporting
C and C++ programming for Palm OS. It supplies a full GCC cross-compilation
toolchain for https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_68000_series[m68k] and
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture[ARM], as well as Palm OS-specific
utilities.

As the Palm OS platform faded into oblivion, prc-tools appears to be have been
unmaintained since 2003 and no longer compiles under recent versions of GCC and
Clang. This repo includes a number of patches to enable it to build and run on
modern Linux and macOS systems.
